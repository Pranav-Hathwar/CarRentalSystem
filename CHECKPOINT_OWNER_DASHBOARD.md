# CHECKPOINT: Owner Dashboard - Before Rebuild
**Date:** 2025-12-03
**Status:** Checkpoint saved before rebuilding owner-dashboard.html from scratch

## Current State
- Owner dashboard exists but may have issues
- Functions: showTab, loadPendingBookings, loadCancellationRequests, requestPayment, removeBooking, viewLicense
- Uses /api/bookings endpoint
- Has three tabs: Pending Bookings, Cancellation Requests, Add New Vehicle
- Depends on formatCurrency from script.js

## To Restore
If you need to come back to this point, the owner-dashboard.html file should be restored to its state before the rebuild.

## Note
This checkpoint was created before a complete rebuild of owner-dashboard.html to fix all issues.
